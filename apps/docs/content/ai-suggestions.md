With [Umbraco.AI](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-ai) set up, the editor can translate a message from the language you are comparing against. It can also improve, simplify or shorten the text in the field, or fix its spelling.

## Setting it up

1. Install an Umbraco.AI provider package, for example `Umbraco.AI.OpenAI`. App Translations already installs Umbraco.AI itself.
2. In the **AI** section, add a connection and a chat profile. Put brand voice and tone on the profile as contexts. They apply to every suggestion.
3. In **Settings > App translations**, turn on **Offer in the editor** in the AI assistant card and choose the profile. You can also change the instructions sent with every request there.

:::note
The assistant is off until an administrator turns it on, because it sends the site's text to an AI provider.

## What a suggestion does

A suggestion only fills the field, and the site does not change until you save. The editor checks every suggestion the same way it checks a save. If a reply drops or renames a placeholder, the assistant sends it back once with the reason, and refuses it if the second reply is no better.
